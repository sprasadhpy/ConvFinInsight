            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                ConvFinBot answers real-world financial questions based on the
                ConvFinQA dataset using language models.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> ConvFinQA</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> LLM-powered conversational AI</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide accuratefinancial answers to user queries</li>

                <p>This project demonstrates an agentic financial question answering system designed for faithful, multi-step reasoning over semi-structured financial data. Key components include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data and Domain Understanding:</strong> Incorporates descriptive and summary-level statistics from the ConvFinQA dataset which is enriched with financial document context to ground agent behavior in real-world reporting structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agent Architecture:</strong> Built on top of GPT-3.5 and Unsloth/Qwen1.5-14B the agent engages in multi-turn financial dialogues with capabilities tailored for symbolic and arithmetic reasoning over time-dependent financial variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Reasoning Stack:</strong> Integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Faithful CoT (natural language → symbolic chain execution), and a calculator augmented execution engine to bridge language-level reasoning and numerate fidelity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conversational Evaluation:</strong> Benchmarked on over 200 sampled and synthesized financial dialogues using hybrid CoT and extended symbolic reasoning and grounded by intermediate program verification and trace validation using Langchain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prompting Strategy Benchmark:</strong> Explores diverse prompting schemas—zero-shot, CoT, tool-augmented prompts—logged via LangChain instrumentation to trace reasoning fidelity and deviation patterns in financial statement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Evaluation Module:</strong> Embeds a reflective agent layer for post-hoc verification of answer consistency and reasoning trace alignment, enabling adaptive correction in the loop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended Inference Control:</strong> Leverages <code>&lt;WAIT&gt;</code> tokens and recent s1 delayed decision primitives to support test-time scaffolding technique.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Knowledge Alignment:</strong> Integrates FMP API to inject real-time financial data : facilitating hallucination avoidance and also analysis of agentic failure modes under partial observability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparative Model Evaluation:</strong> Conducts targeted accuracy assessments between GPT-3.5 and fine-tuned Unsloth Qwen1.5-14B across multi-hop financial reasoning scenarios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimization Techniques:</strong> Applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) via Unsloth to improve trajectory faithfulness under reward-aware alignment signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented :</strong> Implements simple RAG pipelines for supporting contextual grounding enabling the agent to condition on structured and semi-structured financial narratives during answer generation.</li>
                </ul>
