Total withheld shares in October = 1474

Therefore, the percentage decrease in average price per share from October to November is 8.92%.",IPG,24.0,"To calculate the percentage decrease in average price per share from October to November, we first need to find the average price per share for each month.

For October:
Total value of shares purchased in October = 1231868 * $20.74 = $25,525,791.92
Total number of shares purchased in October = 1231868

Average price per share for October = Total value of shares purchased in October / Total number of shares purchased in October
Average price per share for October = $25,525,791.92 / 1231868
Average price per share for October = $20.74

For November:
Total value of shares purchased in November = 1723139 * $18.89 = $32,558,960.71
Total number of shares purchased in November = 1723139

Average price per share for November = Total value of shares purchased in November / Total number of shares purchased in November
Average price per share for November = $32,558,960.71 / 1723139
Average price per share for November = $18.89

Now, we can calculate the percentage decrease:
Percentage decrease = ((Average price per share for October - Average price per share for November) / Average price per share for October) * 100
Percentage decrease = (($20.74 - $18.89) / $20.74) * 100
