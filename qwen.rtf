 Q1: by what percentage did total goodwill decline from 2007 to 2008 year end?\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know the percentage decline in total goodwill from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008. \
\
First, I need to find the total goodwill values for both years. Looking at the table provided, under the "balance as of December 31" for 2007 and 2008, the total column should have those numbers. \
\
For 2007, the total is $2,899 million. For 2008, it's $1,447 million. Wait, but I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct rows. Let me double-check the table structure. \
\
The table has rows for different years. The "balance as of December 31 2007" has a total of 2899. Then, after some adjustments and impairments, the "balance as of December 31 2008" is 1447. \
\
So the decline is from 2899 to 1447. To find the percentage decline, I need to calculate the difference between the two and then divide by the original value (2007's total). \
\
Calculating the difference: 2899 - 1447 = 1452. Then, 1452 / 2899 = approximately 0.5008, which is about 50.08%. \
\
But wait, the question says "decline," so it's a decrease. The percentage decline would be 50.08%, which rounds to about 50.1% or maybe they want it as a whole number. Let me check the exact numbers again to be precise. \
\
2899 minus 1447 equals 1452. Dividing 1452 by 2899 gives exactly 0.5008... So 50.08%. Depending on the required decimal places, but the answer might expect rounding to one decimal place, like 50.1%, or maybe two decimal places. However, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps just one decimal is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe they want it as a whole number, like 50%. \
\
But looking at the numbers again: 1452 divided by 28\

Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage decline in total goodwill from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008. \
\
First, I need to find the total goodwill amounts for both years. Looking at the table provided, under the "balance as of December 31" rows. For 2007, the total is $2899 million. For 2008, it's $1447 million.\
\
Wait, let me double-check that. The table has the balance as of December 31, 2007 as $2899 million under the "total" column. Then, after all the adjustments in 2008, the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $1447 million. So yes, those are the starting and ending figures.\
\
To calculate the percentage decline, the formula is: ((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) * 100. \
\
So plugging in the numbers: (2899 - 1447) / 2899 * 100. Let me compute that. \
\
First, subtract 1447 from 2899: 2899 - 1447 = 1452. Then divide that by 2899: 1452 / 2899 \uc0\u8776  0.4998. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: approximately 49.98%. \
\
So rounding that, it's about a 50% decline. Let me check the exact numbers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \
\
Yes, 2899 minus 1447 is indeed 1452. Divided by 2899, which gives roughly 0.5, so 50%. The answer should be 50% decline.\
<ANSWER>50%</ANSWER> \
\
The total goodwill declined by 50% from 2007 to 2008. The calculation is as follows:\
\
- **2007 Total Goodwill**: $2,899 million  \
- **2008 Total Goodwill**: $1,447 million  \
- **Decline**: $2,899 - $1\

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the growth rate in net revenues in 2011. From the context provided, I need to look at the comparison between 2011 and 2010.\
\
Looking at the table, the total net revenues for 2011 are $17,280 million, and for 2010, it's $21,796 million. The text also mentions that net revenues in 2011 were 21% lower than 2010. So the growth rate here is a decrease of 21%. The answer should reflect that it's a 21% decrease compared to the previous year. I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the years. The question is about 2011's growth rate, which is relative to 2010. The context clearly states a 21% decrease, so that's the figure to use.\

The portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders that is to be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 399,165 shares. This is specified in column (a) of the provided table under the "equity compensation plans approved by security holders" row. The weighted-average exercise price for these is $0.00, and there are 3,995,600 shares remaining available for future issuance under these plans, as indicated in column (c). However, the specific number of shares to be issued upon exercise is 399,165.\
\
<ANSWER>399,165 shares</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the portion of the equity compensation plan approved by security holders that's to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights.\
\
Looking at the context provided, there's a table with columns (a), (b), and (c). The first column (a) is the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, etc. For the plans approved by security holders, the value in column (a) is 399,165. The question specifically asks for the portion related to the approved plans, so that's the number in column (a). \
\
The other columns might be distractors, like column (b) is the weighted average exercise price, which is $0.00 here, and column (c) is the remaining available shares. But the question is about the portion that's to be issued upon exercise, which is column (a). \
\
Also, the footnotes mention that the 399,165 includes grants from two different plans, but the total number remains the same. The answer should just be the number from column (a) for the approved plans. The answer provided earlier was 399,165 shares, which matches the data. So the answer is correct.\

 Q4: what is the percentage change in the total value of outstanding balance from 2011 to 2012?\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
To determine the percentage change in the total value of the outstanding balance from 2011 to 2012, we first need to calculate the total value for each year.\
\
For 2011, the total value of outstanding shares is calculated by multiplying the number of shares by the weighted average grant date fair value:\
1,432,610 shares * $57 = $81,658,770.\
\
For 2012, the total value of outstanding shares is:\
1,913,527 shares * $54 = $102,330,458.\
\
Next, we calculate the percentage change using the formula:\
Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100.\
\
Substituting the values:\
Percentage Change = ((102,330,458 - 81,658,770) / 81,658,770) * 100 \uc0\u8776  25.36%.\
\
<ANSWER>25.36%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let me try to figure out the percentage change in the total value of the outstanding balance from 2011 to 2012. \
\
First, I need to look at the data provided. The context mentions that the weighted average grant date fair value for 2011 is $57 per share, and the number of shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, is 1,432,610. So, the total value for 2011 would be the number of shares multiplied by the fair value. That's 1,432,610 * $57. Let me calculate that: 1,432,610 * 57. Hmm, maybe breaking it down: 1,432,610 * 50 is 71,630,500 and 1,432,610 * 7 is 10,028,270. Adding those together gives 71,630,500 + 10,028,270 = 81,658,770. So, $81,658,7\

To find the percentage change in the total value of outstanding balance from 2011 to 2012, we need to compare the total fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares at the end of 2012 to the total fair value at the end of 2011.\
\
In 2011, the weighted average grant date fair value of outstanding shares was $57, and the number of shares was 1,432,610. The total value for 2011 is calculated as follows:\
\
Total value in 2011 = Number of shares * Weighted average grant date fair value\
<ANSWER>1,432,610 * $57 = $81,658,770</ANSWER>\

 Q5: what was the percentage increase for diesel fuel prices from 2009 to 2010?\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
The percentage increase for diesel fuel prices from 2009 to 2010 was 31%. This is calculated by taking the difference in price between the two years, which is $2.29 - $1.75 = $0.54, and then dividing that by the 2009 price of $1.75, which gives 0.54 / 1.75 = 0.31, or 31%.\
<ANSWER>31%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let me figure out the answer to the question: "What was the percentage increase for diesel fuel prices from 2009 to 2010?" \
\
First, I need to look at the context provided. The user mentioned that in the context, there's information about fuel prices. Let me scan through the text again.\
\
Looking at the "fuel" section under the context, it says: "higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.29 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2010 compared to $1.75 per gallon in 2009, increased expenses by $566 million." So the prices for 2009 and 2010 are given as $1.75 and $2.29 per gallon respectively.\
\
The question is asking for the percentage increase from 2009 to 2010. To calculate percentage increase, the formula is: \
\
Percentage Increase = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100\
\
Here, the old value (2009) is $1.75, and the new value (2010) is $2.29. Plugging these into the formula:\
\
Difference = 2.29 - 1.75 = 0.54\
\
Then, 0.54 divided by 1.75 equals 0.31. Multiplying by 100 gives 31%. \
\
The context also explicitly states that the fuel price per gallon increased 31% during the year, which matches this calculation. So the answer should be 31%.\

 Q6: what percentage of international facilities' square footage is from owned facilities?\\\\n\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage of international facilities' square footage that comes from owned facilities. \
\
First, I need to find the numbers related to international facilities. From the context provided, under the properties section, there's a breakdown of U.S. and international facilities. The U.S. facilities have 7,459,856 square feet owned and 2,923,257 leased. The international facilities have 7,189,652 square feet owned and 2,223,245 leased. \
\
Wait, the question is specifically about the international facilities. So I need to calculate the percentage of the total international square footage that is owned. \
\
The total international square footage would be the sum of owned and leased. So 7,189,652 (owned) plus 2,223,245 (leased) equals 9,412,897 square feet total. \
\
Then, the percentage owned is (owned / total) * 100. That would be (7,189,652 / 9,412,897) * 100. Let me do the division first. \
\
Dividing 7,189,652 by 9,412,897. Let me approximate this. Let's see, 7.189 million divided by 9.412 million. That's roughly 0.7637. Multiplying by 100 gives 76.37%. \

First, I need to find the total square footage of international facilities. From the context, under the international facilities section, it says: "comprise approximately 7189652 square feet of owned and 2223245 square feet of leased space." Wait, so owned is 7,189,652 and leased is 2,223,245. But wait, the total international square footage would be owned plus leased, right? So total international square footage is 7,189,652 + 2,223,245. Let me check that.\
\
But the question is specifically about the percentage of international facilities' square footage that is owned. So that would be (owned square footage / total international square footage) * 100.\

Predicted:\
To find the percentage change in rental income from 2007 to 2008, we use the formula:\
\
Percentage Change = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100\
\
From the table:\
- Rental income in 2007 was $68 million.\
- Rental income in 2008 was $87 million.\
\
Plugging these values into the formula:\

\
<ANSWER>27.94%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let me figure out the percentage change in rental income from 2007 to 2008. The user provided the numbers: 2007 was $68 million and 2008 was $87 million.\
\
First, I remember that percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between the new value and the old value, dividing that by the old value, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. So the formula is [(New - Old)/Old] * 100.\
\
Plugging in the numbers: New is 87, Old is 68. So 87 minus 68 equals 19. Then divide 19 by 68. Let me do that calculation. 19 divided by 68 is approximately 0.2794. Multiply that by 100 to get 27.94%. \
\
Wait, let me check if I did that right. 68 times 0.2794... 68 * 0.25 is 17, and 0.0294 * 68 is about 2. So total is around 19, which matches the numerator. So yes, that seems correct. \
\
I should also make sure that the question is asking for the percentage change from 2007 to 2008, which is the correct direction. If it were the other way around, it would be different, but the question specifies 2007 to 2008. So the answer is 27.94% increase.\

<ANSWER>27.94%</ANSWER>\
\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in rental income from 2007 to 2008. The data provided in the table shows rental income was $68 million in 2007 and $87 million in 2008. \
\
First, I need to recall the formula for percentage change. It's [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. So here, New Value is 2008's rental income, which is 87, and Old Value is 2007's, which is 68.\
\
Subtracting 68 from 87 gives 19. Then divide that by 68. Let me do the division: 19 divided by 68. Hmm, 68 goes into 19 zero times. Adding a decimal, 68 into 190 is 2 times (136), remainder 54. Bring down a zero: 540. 68*7 is 476, subtract that from 540, get 64. Next zero: 640. 68*9 is 612, remainder 28. So far, it's approximately 0.2794...

<ANSWER>16.67%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage discount given in the reset of the convertible preferred stock issued in the private offering. \
\
First, I need to find the original conversion price and the new price after the reset. From the context, it says that the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share. \
\
So the original price is $31.62, and the new price is $26.35. The discount would be the difference between these two divided by the original price, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\
\
Calculating the difference: $31.62 - $26.35 = $5.27. \
\
Then, divide that by the original price: $5.27 / $31.62. Let me do that division. \
\
5.27 divided by 31.62. Let me approximate. 31.62 times 0.16 is about 5.06. 0.1667 would be approximately 5.27. So that's roughly 16.67%.\

Predicted:\
The expected amortization expense for 2019 is $316 million, which is a decrease from $322 million in 2018. To calculate the growth rate, we can use the formula: ((2019 expense - 2018 expense) / 2018 expense) * 100. This gives us ((316 - 322) / 322) * 100 = -1.86%. Therefore, the expected growth rate in amortization expense in 2019 is -1.86%.\
<ANSWER>-1.86%</ANSWER>\
\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the expected growth rate in amortization expense for 2019. First, I need to find the numbers for 2018 and 2019 from the table provided.\
\
Looking at the table under the "amortization expense related to intangible assets" section, the numbers are listed as follows:\
\
2018: $322 million\
2019: $316 million\
\
So, the growth rate is calculated by taking the difference between 2019 and 2018, divided by 2018's value. That would be (316 - 322)/322. Let me compute that.\
\
316 minus 322 is -6. Then, -6 divided by 322 equals approximately -0.01863, which is -1.863%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's -1.86%. \
\
The user might be interested in understanding whether the amortization expense is increasing or decreasing. Since it's negative, it's a decrease. The answer should clearly state the percentage and note that it's a decline. The previous answer provided by the assistant already did this, so I need to confirm if that's correct.

First, I need to find the amortization expenses for 2018 and 2019. From the table provided, the numbers are $322 million for 2018 and $316 million for 2019. \
\
The growth rate is calculated by taking the difference between the two years and dividing by the 2018 amount. So, the formula would be (2019 expense - 2018 expense) / 2018 expense. \
\
Plugging in the numbers: (316 - 322) / 322. That gives -6 / 322, which equals approximately -0.0186. Converting that to a percentage, it's -1.86%. \
\
Wait, the question specifically asks for the growth rate. Since the expense is decreasing, the growth rate is negative. So the answer should be -1.86%. \
\
I should make sure there are no other factors here. The problem mentions "expected growth rate," and the table provides the projected amortization expenses. So the calculation is straightforward. No need to consider other parts of the context, like the goodwill impairment, since that's unrelated to the amortization expense growth rate. \

First, I'll check the table. For 2015, the Nasdaq Composite Index is 122.81, and in 2016 it's 133.19. To find the growth percentage, the formula is ((Value in 2016 - Value in 2015) / Value in 2015) * 100. \
\
So plugging in the numbers: (133.19 - 122.81) / 122.81. Let me calculate that. The difference is 10.38. Dividing that by 122.81 gives approximately 0.0845. Multiplying by 100 gives 8.45%. \

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the expected growth rate in amortization expense in 2019. First, I need to find the relevant data from the context provided.\
\
Looking at the table under part a, the amortization expense for 2018 is $322 million, 2019 is $316 million, 2020 is $305 million, and so on. Wait, but the question is about the growth rate from 2018 to 2019. So, the numbers for 2018 and 2019 are $322 million and $316 million, respectively.\
\
To calculate the growth rate, I need to find the percentage change between these two years. The formula for growth rate is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, the old value is 2018's $322 million, and the new value is 2019's $316 million. \
\
So plugging in the numbers: (316 - 322)/322 = (-6)/322 \uc0\u8776  -0.0186, which is approximately -1.86%. That means the amortization expense is expected to decrease by 1.86% in 2019 compared to 2018. \
\
Wait, but the question says "expected growth rate." Since it's negative, that's a decline. But maybe the user just wants the absolute value? No, growth rate can be negative. So the answer should be -1.86%. However, I need to check if the numbers are correct. The table shows 2018 as 322 and 2019 as 316. Yes, that's a decrease. So the growth rate is negative. \
\
Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as "expected growth rate" but the actual change is a decrease. So the answer is a negative growth rate. Therefore, the expected growth rate is -1.86%.\

The expected amortization expense for 2019 is $316 million. The growth rate compared to 2018 is calculated as (316 - 322)/322 = -1.86%. Therefore, the expected growth rate is -1.86%.\

<MATH>(316 - 322) / 322 = -1.86%</MATH>\
\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the expected growth rate in amortization expense in 2019. First, I need to find the amortization expenses for 2018 and 2019 from the table provided.\
\
Looking at the table under the "amortization expense related to intangible assets" section, the numbers are listed as follows: 2018 is $322 million, 2019 is $316 million, and so on. \
\
So the growth rate would be calculated by taking the difference between 2019 and 2018, divided by the 2018 value. That formula is (2019 value - 2018 value) / 2018 value. Plugging in the numbers: (316 - 322) / 322. \
\
Calculating the numerator: 316 minus 322 is -6. Then divide that by 322, which gives approximately -0.01863, or -1.86% when converted to a percentage. \
\
I should check if there are any other factors mentioned that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the amortization expenses for previous years were $323M, $326M, $337M for 2017, 2016, 2015. But the question specifically asks about 2019, so the table's numbers are the relevant ones here. \
\
Also, the answer provided earlier by the assistant was -1.86%, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be correct. The key is to ensure that the numbers from the table are used correctly and that the formula for growth rate is applied properly. There's no mention of compounding or\

The percentage change in rental income from 2005 to 2006 can be calculated by taking the difference between the two years' values, dividing by the 2005 value, and multiplying by 100. The rental income in 2005 was $59 million and in 2006 was $83 million. The difference is $83 - $59 = $24 million. Dividing this by $59 gives 0.4068, and multiplying by 100 gives a percentage change of approximately 40.68%. <ANSWER>40.68%</ANSWER>\
\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in rental income from 2005 to 2006. I need to look at the table provided. The table shows rental income for 2005 as $59 million and for 2006 as $83 million.\
\
First, I remember that percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between the new value and the old value, dividing by the old value, then multiplying by 100. So the formula is ((New - Old)/Old) * 100.\
\
Plugging in the numbers: (83 - 59) / 59 * 100. Let me do the math. 83 minus 59 is 24. Then 24 divided by 59 equals approximately 0.40678. Multiply by 100 gives 40.678%, which rounds to 40.68%. \
\
I should check if there's any other information in the context that might affect this calculation. The context mentions environmental liabilities and other income components, but the question is specifically about rental income, which is clearly listed in the table.

<ANSWER>39.83%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in rental income from 2005 to 2006. Alright, first I need to find the rental income numbers for those two years. Looking at the table provided, under the "rental income" row, 2005 shows $59 million and 2006 shows $83 million.\
\
So, percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between the new value (2006) and the old value (2005), then dividing by the old value and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. The formula is ((New - Old)/Old) * 100. \

Plugging in the numbers: (83 - 59) = 24. Then divide 24 by 59, which is approximately 0.40678. Multiply that by 100 to get 40.678%, which rounds to 40.68%. Wait, but the original answer given was 39.83%. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check the calculation again.\
\
Wait, 83 minus 59 is indeed 24. Then 24 divided by 59. Let me do that division more accurately. 24 divided by 59. Let's see, 59 goes into 24 zero times. Add a decimal: 240 divided by 59 is 4 (4*59=236). Subtract 236 from 240, you get 4. Bring down a zero: 40. 59 goes into 40 zero times. Next zero: 400. 59*\

Predicted:\
The percentage change in interest payments from 2011 to 2012 is calculated by taking the difference between the two years' interest payments, dividing by the 2011 amount, and multiplying by 100. The interest payments were $326 million in 2011 and $378 million in 2012. The difference is $52 million. Dividing $52 million by $326 million gives 0.1595, or 15.95%. Therefore, the percentage change is 15.95%.\
<ANSWER>15.95%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in interest payments from 2011 to 2012. I need to use the data provided in the context.\
\
First, I should locate the interest payments for those two years. Looking through the context, there's a section that says: "interest payments were $378 million in 2012, $326 million in 2011, and $337 million in 2010." So 2011 is $326M and 2012 is $378M.\
\
The formula for percentage change is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the old value is 2011's $326M, and the new value is 2012's $378M. \
\
Calculating the difference: 378 - 326 = 52. Then divide that by 326: 52 / 326. Let me do that division. 52 divided by 326 equals approximately 0.1595. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 15.95%. \
\
I need to make sure there's no other information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions some debt exchanges and other financial activities, but the interest payments are directly given, so those figures should be accurate. Also, the answer needs to be in the specified format with the percentage enclosed in <ANSWER> tags. The example provided earlier uses 15.95%, so that's the correct value here.\

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking for the difference between the growth of benefit payments and the expected subsidy receipts from 2009 to 2010. \
\
First, I need to look at the table provided. The table has columns for benefit payments, expected subsidy receipts, and net benefit payments. The years listed are 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and then a line for 2014 which seems to have a typo, maybe it's supposed to be 2014-2018? But the question is only about 2009 and 2010, so I can ignore the other years for now.\
\
For 2009, the benefit payments are $2,641 (thousands) and expected subsidy receipts are $77. In 2010, benefit payments increased to $3,139 and subsidy receipts went up to $91. \
\
The question is about the growth (increase) of each between these two years and the difference between those growths. \
\
So first, calculate the growth in benefit payments from 2009 to 2010. That's 2010's benefit payments minus 2009's. So 3,139 - 2,641 = 498 (in thousands). \
\
Then, calculate the growth in expected subsidy receipts. 2010's subsidy receipts (91) minus 2009's (77) = 14 (in thousands). \
\
Now, the difference between these two growths would be the growth of benefit payments (498) minus the growth of subsidy receipts (14). That would be 498 - 14 = 484 (in thousands). \
\
Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the difference in their growth rates? But the wording says "difference between the growth of the benefit payments and the expected subsidy receipts".

Wait, the table's first row is labeled 2009, then 2010, etc. So the numbers are in thousands, as per the context. But the question is about the growth between these two years. \

So, growth in benefit payments from 2009 to 2010 would be (2010 value - 2009 value) / 2009 value * 100%? Or maybe just the absolute difference? Wait, the question says "growth of the benefit payments and the expected subsidy receipts." Hmm, but the exact wording is "difference between the growth of the benefit payments and the expected subsidy receipts." So maybe compute the growth rate for each and subtract them?\
\
Wait, let me parse the question again: "difference between the growth of the benefit payments and the expected subsidy receipts" for the years 2009 and 2010. So perhaps calculate the growth rate of each (benefit payments and subsidy receipts) from 2009 to 2010, then subtract the two growth rates to find the difference.\
\
Alternatively, maybe the growth in each category (i.e., the increase in benefit payments and the increase in subsidy receipts) and then find the difference between those two increases. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think.\
\
The term "growth" here could mean the change in value. So for each category (benefit payments and subsidy receipts), calculate the change from 2009 to 2010, and then find the difference between these two changes.\

 Q21: what is the percentage change in interest expense from 2012 to 2013?\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in interest expense from 2012 to 2013. \
\
First, I need to look at the table provided. The table shows interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. The numbers are in thousands of dollars. \
\
For 2012, the interest expense is $20,454 thousand. In 2013, it's $8,181 thousand. The question is about the change from 2012 to 2013, so I need to calculate the percentage decrease here.\
\
The formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, the old value is 2012's expense, and the new value is 2013's. \
\
Plugging in the numbers: (8,181 - 20,454) / 20,454. Let me compute that. \
\
First, subtract 8,181 from 20,454: 20,454 - 8,181 = 12,273. Wait, but since it's (New - Old), it's 8,181 - 20,454 = -12,273. Then divide by 20,454. \
\
So -12,273 / 20,454 = approximately -0.5999, which is about -60%. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \
\
So the percentage change is a decrease of approximately 60%. I need to check if the numbers are correct. The table says 2012 is 20,454 and 2013 is 8,181. Yes. So the calculation seems right. The answer should be a 60% decrease, so the percentage change is -60%, but since the question asks for the percentage change, it's -60% or a 60% decrease. Depending on how they want it presented. The problem says "percentage change," which can be negative. But sometimes people refer to the absolute value. However, the formula includes the sign.\

Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage change in interest expense from 2012 to 2013. \
\
First, I need to find the interest expense numbers for those two years. Looking at the table provided, the interest expense for 2012 is $20,454 thousand and for 2013 it's $8,181 thousand. \
\
Wait, percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between the two years and dividing by the original value. So the formula should be ((2013 value - 2012 value)/2012 value) * 100 to get the percentage.\
\
Let me plug in the numbers. The difference between 2013 and 2012 is 8,181 - 20,454. That gives a negative number, which makes sense because the expense decreased. Then divide that by the 2012 value. \
\
Calculating the numerator: 8,181 - 20,454 = -12,273. Then divide by 20,454. So -12,273 / 20,454. Let me compute that. \
\
Hmm, dividing -12,273 by 20,454. Let me do that division. Let's see, 12,273 divided by 20,454 is approximately 0.6, but since it's negative, it's -0.6. Wait, let me check with exact numbers. \
\
If I take 12,273 divided by 20,454, that's roughly 0.6, but let me do it more accurately. Let's divide both numerator and denominator by 3 to simplify. 12,273 \'f73 is 4,091. 20,454 \'f73 is 6,818. So 4,091 / 6,818. Let me approximate that. 4,091 \'f7 6,818 \uc0\u8776  0.6. So approximately 0.6, which is 60%. So the percentage change is -60%. \

Wait, but let me confirm with exact calculation. Let me use the actual numbers.\

 Q22: what was the change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2017 to 2018\

The change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2017 to 2018 is calculated by subtracting the 2017 value from the 2018 value. According to the table, the 2018 value is 286.8 million and the 2017 value is 290.6 million. Therefore, the change is 286.8 - 290.6 = -3.8 million shares. <ANSWER>-3.8 million shares</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the change in the weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations from 2017 to 2018.\
\
First, I need to locate the relevant numbers in the table provided. The table has columns for 2018, 2017, and 2016. The row labeled "weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations" should have those figures. \
\
Looking at the table, for 2018, the number is 286.8 million, and for 2017, it's 290.6 million. The question is about the change from 2017 to 2018, so I need to subtract the 2017 value from the 2018 value. \
\
Calculating that: 286.8 minus 290.6 equals -3.8. The negative sign indicates a decrease. The units are in millions, so the answer should be -3.8 million shares. \
\
I should also check if there's any additional context that might affect this calculation. The note mentions that there were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards in those years, so the numbers provided are straightforward. The explanation in the context about how diluted EPS is calculated includes the dilutive effects of equity awards, but since the question is purely about the change in the weighted average shares, the numbers from the table are sufficient. \

Therefore, the answer is a decrease of 3.8 million shares, which is represented as -3.8 million shares.\

First, I need to look at the table provided. The table has data for December 31, 2017; September 30, 2017; and December 31, 2016. The column for HQLA in excess of net outflows is $82.1 billion for December 31, 2017, and $71.3 billion for December 31, 2016. \
\
So, the increase from 2016 to 2017 is 82.1 - 71.3 = 10.8 billion dollars. \
\
To find the percentage increase, I need to divide the increase by the original value (2016's HQLA excess) and multiply by 100. \
\
Calculating that: (10.8 / 71.3) * 100. Let me do the division first. 10.8 divided by 71.3. Let me approximate that. 71.3 times 0.15 is about 10.695, which is very close to 10.8. So that's approximately 15%. \
\
Wait, exactly: 10.8 / 71.3 = 0.1514... So multiplying by 100 gives 15.14%. The question says "percentage increase," so I should round it to one decimal place or as per the data's precision. The numbers in the table are given to one decimal place, so maybe one decimal. But the answer might be expected as a whole number if the exact calculation is 15.14%, which is approximately 15.1% or 15%. However, looking at the note, the amounts are presented on an average basis. But the question is about the percentage increase. \

\
To find the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. \
\
So plugging in the numbers: (82.1 - 71.3) / 71.3 * 100. Let me compute that. \

\
The answer should be rounded to two decimal places, maybe? The original numbers are given to one decimal place, but the percentage might be presented with two decimals. Alternatively, check if the problem expects a specific rounding. However, since the data is in billions and the difference is 10.8, the exact calculation would be 10.8 / 71.3 * 100.

Yes, 10.8 divided by 71.3 equals approximately 0.1515, which is 15.15%. So the percentage increase is 15.15%. \

First, I need to look at the table provided. The table lists the future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases. The total minimum lease payments are given as $5,457 million for operating leases and $1,916 million for capital leases. Wait, but the question says "total future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases," so I need to add those two totals together. \
\
So total minimum lease payments = operating leases total + capital leases total = 5,457 + 1,916. Let me calculate that. 5,457 + 1,916 equals 7,373 million dollars.\
\
Now, the amount due in 2009 is listed under the operating leases as $498 million and capital leases as $168 million. So the total for 2009 is 498 + 168 = 666 million.\
\
To find the percentage, I take the 2009 amount divided by the total minimum lease payments. So that's 666 / 7,373. Let me compute that. \
\
First, 666 divided by 7,373. Let me approximate. Let's see, 7,373 divided by 100 is 73.73. So 666 divided by 73.73 is approximately 9. So 9%? Wait, but let me do the exact calculation. \

The total minimum lease payments are given as $5,457 million for operating leases and $1,916 million for capital leases. Wait, but the question is about the total of both operating and capital leases. So the total would be 5457 + 1916. Let me check that again. \
\
Wait, the table has two sections: operating leases and capital leases. The total minimum lease payments for operating leases is $5,457 million, and for capital leases it's $1,916 million. So the combined total is 5457 + 1916 = 7,373 million. \
\
But the question specifically asks for the percent due in 2009. Looking at the rows for each year, in 2009, operating leases are $498 million and capital leases are $168 million. So the amount due in 2009 is 498 + 168 = 666 million.\
\
Now, to find the percentage, I need to take the 2009 amount divided by the total future minimum lease payments. So that's 666 / 7373. Let me compute that. \
\
First, let me confirm the numbers again. The total future minimum lease payments are operating leases total ($5,457) plus capital leases total ($1,916), which is indeed 5457 + 1916 = 7373. The 2009 amount is operating 498 + capital 168 = 666. \

So 666 divided by 7373. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 666 / 7373 \uc0\u8776  0.0903. To convert to percentage, multiply by 100, so approximately 9.03%. Wait, but the answer given in the example was 11.1%. Hmm, that's conflicting. Did I do something wrong here?\

Under the "total minimum lease payments" row, the operatingleases column is $5,457 million, and the capital leases column is $1,916 million. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the total minimum lease payments should be the sum of operating and capital leases. But the way the table is structured, the "total minimum lease payments" are split into operating and capital. So maybe the total is 5,457 plus 1,916? But that would be 7,373 million.

First, I need to look at the table provided. The table has two columns: operating leases and capital leases. The total minimum lease payments are given as $5,457 million for operating leases and $1,916 million for capital leases. Wait, no, actually, looking at the table, the "total minimum lease payments" row shows $5,457 for operating leases and $1,916 for capital leases. But wait, the way the table is structured, the "total minimum lease payments" is the sum of all the future payments for each year. But the question is about the total minimum lease payments, which would be the sum of operating and capital leases.\
\
Wait, but the question is asking what percentage of total minimum lease payments are operating leases. So the total minimum lease payments would be the sum of operating leases and capital leases. But looking at the table, the total minimum lease payments for operating leases is $5,457 million and for capital leases is $1,916 million. Wait, no, the way the table is structured, the "total minimum lease payments" row is split into operating and capital. So the total would be the sum of the operating and capital totals. But the numbers given in the table for total minimum lease payments are $5,457 million for operating and $1,916 million for capital. Therefore, the overall total minimum lease payments would be $5,457 + $1,916. Let me check that again.\
\
Wait, the table has a row labeled "total minimum lease payments" with the values $5,457 (operating leases) and $1,916 (capital leases). So the total minimum lease payments across both types would be the sum of those two numbers. Therefore, total minimum lease payments = 5,457 + 1,916 = 7,373 million.\
\
But the question is asking for the percentage of total minimum lease payments that are operating leases. So the operating leases are $5,457 million, and the total is 7,373 million. Therefore, the percentage is (5,457 / 7,373) * 100.\

 Q28: what was the difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return for united parcel service inc . versus the standard & poor's 500 index for the five years ended 12/31/2016?\

--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
Okay, let's see. I need to find the difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return between United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and the S&P 500 Index from December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2016.\
\
First, I'll check the table provided. The values given are for each year-end from 2011 to 2016. The initial investment is $100 for each. The question is about the five-year period ending 12/31/2016, so I need to look at the values for that date.\
\
For UPS, the value on 12/31/2016 is $189.72. The S&P 500 Index is at $198.09 on the same date.\
\
To find the cumulative return percentage, I need to calculate how much each has grown from the initial $100. The formula for cumulative return is ((Ending Value / Initial Value) - 1) * 100%.\
\
So for UPS: (189.72 / 100 - 1) * 100% = 89.72% return.\
\
For S&P 500: (198.09 / 100 - 1) * 100% = 98.09% return.\
\
Now, the difference between the two is 98.09% (S&P) minus 89.72% (UPS) = 8.37 percentage points. But wait, the question asks for the difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return. So it's the absolute difference, which is 8.37%.\
\
Wait, but maybe I need to check if the question is about the difference in the returns, so UPS's return is 89.72%, S&P is 98.09%, so the difference is 98.09 - 89.72 = 8.37%. So the answer should be 8.37 percentage points. But the question says "difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return", so the answer is 8.37%.\

The question asks for the difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return for United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) versus the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) over the five years ended December 31, 2016. \
\
First, we need to calculate the cumulative return for each. The cumulative return is calculated by comparing the value on December 31, 2016, to the initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2011.\
\
For UPS:\
- Initial investment: $100\
- Value on 12/31/2016: $189.72\
- Cumulative return = (Final Value / Initial Value) - 1\
- Cumulative return = (189.72 / 100) - 1 = 0.8972 or 89.72%\
\
For S&P 500:\
- Initial investment: $100\
- Value on 12/31/2016: $198.09\
- Cumulative return = (Final Value / Initial Value) - 1\
- Cumulative return = (198.09 / 100) - 1 = 0.9809 or 98.09%\
\
Now, calculate the difference in percentage returns:\
- Difference = UPS return - S&P 500 return\
- Difference = 89.72% - 98.09% = -8.37%\

Therefore, the difference in percentage cumulative total shareowners return for UPS versus the S&P 500 for the five years ended 12/31/2016 is -8.37%.\

<ANSWER>4%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the growth rate in operating profit for the aeronautics segment in 2012. I need to find this information in the provided context.\
\
Looking through the text, there's a section that compares 2012 to 2011. It mentions that "aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $69 million, or 4% (4%), compared to 2011." So the growth rate is 4%. The numbers in parentheses might be for clarity or to show the percentage change. The key part here is "increased... 4%". \
\
I should make sure there's no other mention of a different rate. The table shows operating profit for 2012 as 1699 and 2011 as 1630. Let me check the math. The increase is 69 million. To find the growth rate, it's (69 / 1630) * 100. Let me calculate that. 69 divided by 1630 is approximately 0.0423, which is 4.23%. Wait, but the text says 4%. Hmm, maybe they rounded it. The text explicitly states 4%, so even though the exact calculation might be 4.23%, the answer given in the context is 4%. Therefore, the answer should be 4% as per the provided information.\

The key sentence here is that the operating profit for 2012 increased by 4% compared to 2011. The text explicitly states that the increase was $69 million, which is a 4% growth. The mention of 2019 in the context might be an error, but the data provided for 2012 vs. 2011 shows a 4% growth rate. \

<ANSWER>-0.36%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let me figure out the percentage change in the balance of goodwill from 2014 to 2015. \
\
First, I need to find the goodwill balances for those years. The table provided shows the balance at the beginning of the year for 2015 as $1,642,438. Wait, but the question is from 2014 to 2015. The balance at the beginning of 2015 would actually be the end of 2014. So the starting point is 2014's end balance, which is the beginning of 2015. Then the end of 2015 is $1,636,526.\
\
So the change is $1,636,526 (end of 2015) minus $1,642,438 (beginning of 2015, which is end of 2014). That gives a difference of -$5,912. \
\
To find the percentage change, divide the change by the original amount (2014's balance) and multiply by 100. So (-$5,912 / $1,642,438) * 100. Let me calculate that. \
\
Dividing 5,912 by 1,642,438 gives approximately 0.0036, so multiplying by 100 gives 0.36%. Since it's a decrease, the percentage change is -0.36%. \

The percentage change is calculated as [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100. So, [(1,636,526 - 1,642,438) / 1,642,438] * 100. This equals (-5,912 / 1,642,438) * 100, which is approximately -0.36%. Therefore, the percentage change in the balance of goodwill from 2014 to 2015 is -0.36%.\
<ANSWER>-0.36%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in the balance of goodwill from 2014 to 2015. Hmm, I need to look at the table provided. The table has columns for 2016 and 2015. The "balance at beginning of year" for 2015 is $1,642,438. Wait, but the question is from 2014 to 2015. However, the table doesn't have a 2014 column. The earliest data here is 2015's beginning balance. Wait, the balance at the beginning of 2015 would be the end of 2014. So the 2014 balance is $1,642,438. Then in 2015, the balance at the end of the year is $1,636,526. So that's the change from 2014 to 2015. \
\
So the formula for percentage change is ((New - Old)/Old)*100. Here, New is 2015's end balance, which is $1,636,526. Old is 2014's balance, which is the beginning of 2015, $1,642,438. So subtracting them: 1,6\

First, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that the company has operating leases with future minimum rental payments. There's a table showing the fiscal years and the corresponding operating lease amounts. The data given is for fiscal years 2008 through later years, with the total being $91,478.

Wait, the question is about the growth rate in 2008. But the table shows the future minimum rental payments required under long-term operating leases as of November 3, 2007. The fiscal year 2008 payment is listed as $30,774. However, the actual rental expense for fiscal 2007 was $43 million. So, the growth rate would be the increase from 2007 to 2008.\
\
But wait, the numbers in the table are in thousands? Because $30,774 seems low compared to the $43 million mentioned. Wait, looking back at the table, the numbers might be in thousands. For example, the total is $91,478, which would be $91.478 million. The 2008 figure is $30,774, which would be $30.774 million. Then the 2007 expense was $43 million. But the problem is that the table shows the future minimum rental payments, which are commitments, not the actual expenses. The actual rental expenses for 2007 were $43 million, but the 2008 commitment is $30.774 million. However, the user is asking for the growth rate in rental expense. But the actual expense for 2008 isn't given directly. The table shows the minimum rental payments required, which might be the committed amounts, but the actual expense could be different.

Hmm, in a purchase price allocation, the total purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The formula is: Purchase Price = Assets Acquired - Liabilities Assumed + Goodwill. Wait, no. Actually, the fair value of net assets acquired is the assets acquired minus the liabilities assumed. Then, the total purchase price is that net amount plus goodwill.

Predicted:\
The fluctuation of the credit spread between 2008 and 2009 is 2 basis points. This is calculated by taking the difference between the debit valuation adjustment sensitivity values for December 31, 2009 ($39 million) and December 31, 2008 ($37 million), resulting in a 2 basis point increase. However, it is important to note that the sensitivity values represent the impact of a one-basis-point increase in JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads, not the actual credit spread changes. Therefore, the actual fluctuation in credit spreads is not directly provided in the data, but the change in sensitivity is 2 basis points.\
\
Wait, that answer is incorrect. The question asks for the fluctuation of the credit spread, but the table shows the sensitivity to a one-basis-point increase, not the actual change in credit spreads. The values in the table are the dollar amounts resulting from a 1 basis point increase in credit spreads. Therefore, the actual credit spread fluctuation is not directly provided in the given data. The answer should clarify that the data does not provide the actual credit spread changes, only the sensitivity to changes. \
\
So, the correct answer is that the provided data does not indicate the actual fluctuation of the credit spread in basis points for 2008 and 2009. Instead, it shows the sensitivity of DVA to a one-basis-point increase in credit spreads, which is $37 million for 2008 and $39 million for 2009. Therefore, the sensitivity increased by $2 million, but this does not translate to a 2 basis point change in the credit spread itself. The actual credit spread change is not provided in the context.\

However, these values represent the impact of a one-basis-point change in the credit spread, not the actual change in the credit spread itself.\
\
The actual credit spread values are not provided in the information given. The DVA sensitivity is a measure of how much the DVA would change in response to a one-basis-point change in the credit spread, but it does not indicate the actual change in the credit spread between the two years. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the fluctuation of the credit spread in basis points from the provided data.\

 Q35: what is the average rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month from 2008-2010 , in millions?\
\
--- Qwen (LLM Only) ---\
Predicted:\
To find the average rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month from 2008 to 2010, we need to take the rent expenses for each of those years and find their average.\
\
The rent expenses provided are:\
- 2010: $624 million\
- 2009: $686 million\
- 2008: $747 million\
\
To calculate the average, we add these amounts together and then divide by the number of years:\
\
Average = (624 + 686 + 747) / 3\
\
Let's do the math:\
\
624 + 686 = 1310\
1310 + 747 = 2057\
2057 / 3 = 685.666... \
\
Rounding to the nearest whole number, the average rent expense is approximately $686 million.\
\
<ANSWER>686</ANSWER>\
The average rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month from 2008 to 2010 is calculated by taking the sum of the expenses for each year and dividing by the number of years. The expenses are $747 million in 2008, $686 million in 2009, and $624 million in 2010. Adding these together gives $747 + $686 + $624 = $2057 million. Dividing this by 3 years gives an average of $2057 / 3 \uc0\u8776  $685.67 million. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is $686 million.\

<ANSWER>686.33</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the average rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month from 2008 to 2010. The context provided has the rent expenses for those years: 2010 was $624 million, 2009 was $686 million, and 2008 was $747 million.\
\
So, to find the average, I need to add up those three numbers and divide by 3. Let me check the numbers again. 2008: 747, 2009: 686, 2010: 624. Adding them together: 747 + 686 is 1433, plus 624 makes 2057. Then divide by 3. Let me do that calculation. 2057 divided by 3 equals approximately 685.666..., which rounds to 685.67. But wait, the answer given in the example was 686.33. Wait, maybe I added wrong?\
\
Wait, let me check the addition again. 747 (2008) + 686 (2009) = 747 + 686. Let's compute that step by step. 700 + 600 = 1300, 47 + 86 = 133. So total is 1300 + 133 = 1433. Then add 624 (2010): 1433 + 624. 1400 + 600 = 2000, 33 + 24 = 57. So total is 2057. Yes, that's correct. Then 2057 divided by 3. Let me compute that again. 3 \'d7 685 = 2055. So 2057 - 2055 = 2. So 685 + 2/3 \uc0\u8776  685.666..., which is 685\

\
Looking at the table provided, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the EBITDA is $1,033.9 million, and the adjusted EBITDA is $1,018.5 million. So adjusted EBITDA is actually lower than EBITDA. But wait, the question is about whether adjusted EBITDA increased more than the actual EBITDA. Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me check the definitions again.\
\
The context says that adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for certain items. The table shows that EBITDA is 1033.9 for 2015, and adjusted EBITDA is 1018.5. So adjusted EBITDA is less than EBITDA. Therefore, the answer would be no, because adjusted EBITDA is lower than EBITDA. But the question is phrased as "did 2015 adjusted EBITDA increase more than 2015 actual EBITDA?" Maybe the user is asking if the adjusted EBITDA is higher than the actual EBITDA. But according to the numbers, it's lower. So the answer would be no. But maybe I need to check the adjustments. The adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA minus some items. For example, in 2015, they subtracted non-cash equity-based compensation, net loss on extinguishment of debt, etc. So adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA minus those adjustments. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA is lower than EBITDA. Therefore, the answer is no, it didn't increase more than actual EBITDA. Instead, adjusted EBITDA is less than EBITDA. So the answer is no.\

\
First, let's look at the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for 2015. From the table, under the years ended December 31, 2015, EBITDA is $1,033.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is $1,018.5 million. So adjusted EBITDA is actually less than the actual EBITDA. The question is asking if adjusted EBITDA increased more than the actual EBITDA. But wait, "increase" here might be a bit confusing. Are they comparing adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA? Or are they looking at the change from a previous year?\
\
Wait, the question says "did 2015 adjusted EBITDA increase more than 2015 actual EBITDA?" That phrasing is a bit unclear. Maybe they mean, was the adjusted EBITDA higher than the actual EBITDA in 2015? But looking at the numbers, adjusted EBITDA is $1,018.5 million, and EBITDA is $1,033.9 million. So adjusted EBITDA is actually lower than EBITDA. Therefore, the answer would be no, because adjusted EBITDA is less than the actual EBITDA. \
\
Alternatively, if the question is asking whether adjusted EBITDA increased (from 2014 to 2015) by a larger amount than the actual EBITDA increased. Let's check that. For 2015, EBITDA is 1,033.9, and in 2014 it's 792.9. So the increase in EBITDA is 1,033.9 - 792.9 = 241.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 is 1,018.5, and in 2014 it's 907\

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in total operating expenses in 2012. So, I need to compare the total operating expenses between 2012 and 2011 because the question is about the change in 2012, which would be from the previous year, 2011.\
\
Looking at the table provided, the total operating expenses for 2012 are $22,956 million, and for 2011, it's $22,642 million. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the table has columns for 2012, 2011, and 2010. The numbers are:\
\
Year ended December 2012: $22,956\
Year ended December 2011: $22,642\
Year ended December 2010: $26,269\
\
So, the question is about the percentage change in 2012. That would be the change from 2011 to 2012. So the formula for percentage change is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. \
\
So, plugging in the numbers: (22,956 - 22,642) / 22,642 * 100. Let me calculate that. \
\
First, subtract 22,642 from 22,956: 22,956 - 22,642 = 314. Then divide that by 22,642. Let me do that division. 314 / 22,642 \uc0\u8776  0.01387. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 1.387%.

Okay, let me figure out how to calculate the percentage change in total operating expenses from 2011 to 2012. The user is asking specifically about 2012, so I need to compare 2012's total operating expenses with 2011's.\
\
First, I'll check the table provided. The total operating expenses for 2012 are $22,956 million, and for 2011, it's $22,642 million. Wait, but the question says "percentage change in total operating expenses in 2012." Hmm, percentage change usually refers to the change from the previous year. So, it's likely asking for the change from 2011 to 2012.\

Wait, but let me confirm the numbers again. The table lists 2012 total operating expenses as $22,956 million and 2011 as $22,642 million. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation seems right. The answer should be approximately 1.39% increase. But maybe they want it rounded to one decimal place or two? The original data has the numbers in millions, but the percentage is small.

<ANSWER>9.41%</ANSWER>\
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know the percentage of interest and penalties included in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) as of January 1, 2007. \
\
First, I need to find the relevant numbers from the provided context. The context mentions that at January 1, 2007, the gross UTB balance was $691 million. Also, the accrued interest and penalties on a gross basis were $65 million at that same date.\
\
So the formula to calculate the percentage would be (Interest and Penalties / Gross UTB) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: (65 / 691) * 100. Let me do that calculation. \
\
Dividing 65 by 691 gives approximately 0.0941. Multiplying by 100 converts that to 9.41%. \
\
I should check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation, but the context doesn't mention any other components related to interest and penalties in the gross UTB for that date. The answer seems straightforward with the given numbers.\

Okay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking: "At January 1, 2007, what was the percent of the interest and penalties included in the gross unrecognized tax benefits?" \
\
First, I need to understand what the question is really asking. It wants the percentage of interest and penalties relative to the gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) as of January 1, 2007. \
\
Looking at the context provided, there's a table that gives some numbers. Let me check the table again. The table shows that at January 1, 2007, the gross UTB balance was $691 million. Then, there are various additions and reductions leading to the December 31, 2007, balance. \
\
But the question is about January 1, 2007. The text also mentions that at January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, the accrued interest and penalties on a gross basis were $65 million and $69 million, respectively. \
\
Wait, so the interest and penalties are separate from the gross UTB. The gross UTB is the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits. But the question is about the percentage of interest and penalties that are included in the gross UTB. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the interest and penalties are part of the gross UTB or not. \
\
The text says: "the ending net utb results from adjusting the gross balance... for items such as federal, state, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes." So the net UTB is the gross UTB adjusted by interest and penalties, etc. However, the question is about the percentage of interest and penalties included in the gross UTB. \
\
Wait, but the interest and penalties are separate. The text says "the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense." So, the interest and penalties are part of the tax expense, but are they included in the gross UTB? \

\
First, I need to calculate the difference between the two values. So, 1033 minus 647 equals 386. Then, divide that by the initial value (2010's fair value) which is 1033. So 386 divided by 1033.

The table shows that on January 2, 2016 (which is the end of the fiscal year 2015, I assume), the Nasdaq Composite was at 200.32. Then, on December 31, 2016, the value is 216.54.\
\
The formula for the rate of return is ((Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value) * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (216.54 - 200.32) divided by 200.32, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\

Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the percentage of printing papers sales in 2006 that came from North American printing papers net sales.\
\
First, I need to find the total printing papers sales for 2006. Looking at the table provided, under the "sales" row, the numbers are in millions. For 2006, the sales are listed as $6,700 million. Wait, but the context also mentions specific figures for North American printing papers. \
\
In the context, it says: "North American printing papers net sales in 2007 were $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion in 2006..." Wait, hold on. The user is asking about 2006, so the North American net sales for 2006 are $4.4 billion. But the total sales for printing papers in 2006, according to the table, is $6,700 million, which is $6.7 billion. \
\
Wait, but there's a discrepancy here. The table's "sales" row for 2006 is $6,700 million (so $6.7 billion), but the North American net sales in 2006 are stated as $4.4 billion. However, the context also mentions that in 2006, North American sales were $4.4 billion, but when excluding certain businesses, it was $3.2 billion. But the question is about the total printing papers sales in 2006. \

Wait, the user is asking "what percent of printing papers sales in 2006 was from north american printing papers net sales?" So the total printing papers sales in 2006 is the sum of all regions?

Wait, but the context mentions North American printing papers net sales in 2006 as $4.4 billion. Wait, the numbers here might be in different units. Let me check again.\

The table shows sales for 2006 as $6,700 million. But in the context, it says "north american printing papers net sales in 2007 were $3.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion in 2006..." So in 2006, North American sales were $4.4 billion. But the total sales for printing papers in 2006 according to the table is $6,700 million, which is $6.7 billion. Wait, but there's a discrepancy here. The table's sales numbers are for the entire company's printing papers, while the North American numbers are a part of that.\
\
Wait, the question is about the percentage of total printing papers sales in 2006 that came from North America. So the total sales for printing papers in 2006 is $6,700 million (from the table). The North American net sales in 2006 were $4.4 billion, which is $4,400 million. So to find the percentage, it's (North American sales / Total sales) * 100.\
\
So that's (4,400 / 6,700) * 100. Let me calculate that. 4,400 divided by 6,700 equals approximately 0.6567. Multiply by 100 gives 65.67%. So the answer should be approximately 65.67%.\

Predicted:\
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage change in gross profit from 2009 to 2010. I need to find the gross profit figures for both years and calculate the percentage change.\
\
Looking at the context provided, there's a section that mentions gross profit. It says, "Gross profit increased $120.4 million to $530.5 million in 2010 from $410.1 million in 2009." So, the gross profit in 2010 is $530.5 million and in 2009 it was $410.1 million.\
\
To calculate the percentage change, the formula is: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. \
\
Plugging in the numbers: ((530.5 - 410.1) / 410.1) * 100. Let me do the math. \
\
First, subtract 410.1 from 530.5: 530.5 - 410.1 = 120.4. Then divide that by 410.1: 120.4 / 410.1 \uc0\u8776  0.2936. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 29.36%. \
\
But wait, the context also mentions that the gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) increased by 200 basis points, from 47.9% to 49.9%. However, the question specifically asks about the percentage change in gross profit, not the gross margin. So the answer should be based on the dollar amounts, not the percentage of net revenues. \
\
Therefore, the percentage change in gross profit is approximately 29.36%. But I need to check if the answer is expected to be in whole numbers or with decimals. The original data shows the dollar change as $120.4 million, which is precise. However, the answer might need to be rounded. Let me recalculate the exact percentage.\

Looking at the table, there are three sections: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 is $669.5 million. Then, net cash used in investing activities is -$200.8 million, and net cash (used in) provided by financing activities is -$343.9 million. \
\
To find the net change in cash, I should add these three numbers together. So, 669.5 (operating) minus 200.8 (investing) minus 343.9 (financing). Let me calculate that step by step.\

The combined change to the tax liabilities (both current and long-term) following the SFAS 158 adoption adjustments is calculated by looking at the changes in the deferred taxes (current) and deferred taxes (long-term) from the "prior to application of SFAS 158" to "after application of SFAS 158".\
\
From the table:\
- Deferred taxes (current) changed from $191 to $163, which is a decrease of $28.\
- Deferred taxes (long-term) changed from $186 to $413, which is an increase of $227.\

The combined change to the tax liabilities (both current and long-term) following the SFAS 158 adoption adjustments is $199 million. \
\
<ANSWER>199</ANSWER>\
Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking for the combined change to tax liabilities, both current and long-term, after adopting SFAS 158. \
\
Looking at the table provided, there are two rows for deferred taxes: current and long-term. The columns show the values before applying SFAS 158, the adjustments made, and after applying the standard. \
\
For deferred taxes (current), the value before was $191 million, and after the adjustment, it's $163 million. The adjustment was a decrease of $28 million. That's a negative change for current liabilities.\
\
Then, for deferred taxes (long-term), the value before was $186 million, and after the adjustment, it's $413 million. The adjustment here was an increase of $227 million. That's a positive change for long-term liabilities.\
\
The question is asking for the combined change, so I need to add these two adjustments together. The current deferred taxes decreased by $28 million, and the long-term increased by $227 million. \
\
So, $-28 + $227 equals $199 million. That should be the total change in tax liabilities when combining both current and long-term. \

Okay, let me figure out the answer step by step. The question is asking for the average unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year from 2010 to 2012.\
\
First, I need to look at the table provided. The "unrecognized tax benefits at end of year" for each year are given as:\
\
- 2010: $11.1 million\
- 2011: $11.0 million\
- 2012: $6.8 million\
\
To find the average, I should add these three values together and then divide by the number of years, which is 3. \
\
So adding them up: 11.1 + 11.0 + 6.8. Let me do that calculation. 11.1 plus 11.0 is 22.1, and then adding 6.8 gives 28.9 million total.\
\
Now, divide that sum by 3 to get the average: 28.9 / 3. Let me compute that. 3 goes into 28.9 approximately 9.633... So rounding to two decimal places, that's 9.63 million. \

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent increase in net revenue from 2010 to 2011. I need to calculate that using the numbers provided in the table.\
\
First, I should check the net revenue for both years. From the table, 2010 net revenue is $1,216.7 million and 2011 is $1,252.3 million. \
\
To find the percent increase, the formula is: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. \
\
So plugging in the numbers: (1252.3 - 1216.7) / 1216.7 * 100. Let me do the subtraction first. 1252.3 minus 1216.7 equals 35.6. Then divide that by 1216.7. Let me calculate that. 35.6 divided by 1216.7 is approximately 0.02927. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is about 2.927%. \
\
Rounding to two decimal places, that's 2.93%. Wait, but maybe the question expects one decimal place? Let me check the numbers again. The values are in millions, and the difference is 35.6 over 1216.7. Let me confirm the division again. 35.6 / 1216.7. Let me use a calculator step. 35.6 divided by 1216.7. Let's see, 1216.7 times 0.029 is 35.2843. So 0.029 would be 2.9%, and the actual value is 35.6, which is slightly more. So 0.02927 is about 2.93%.

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent increase in net revenue from 2010 to 2011. Alright, first I need to find the net revenue numbers for both years. From the table provided, 2010 net revenue is $1216.7 million and 2011 is $1252.3 million.\
\
So, to calculate the percent increase, the formula is: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: (1252.3 - 1216.7) / 1216.7 * 100. Let me do the subtraction first. 1252.3 minus 1216.7 equals 35.6. Then divide that by 1216.7. Let me compute that. 35.6 divided by 1216.7 is approximately 0.02927. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is about 2.927%. Rounding to one decimal place, that's 2.9%. \
\
Wait, let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. 2010 is the old value, 2011 is new. Yes, so the calculation is correct. The answer should be 2.9%.\

Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage decrease of state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects from 2002 to 2003. \
\
First, I need to look at the table provided. The table has columns for 2003, 2002, and 2001. The row for "state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects" shows the values for each year. \
\
Looking at the numbers: for 2002, it's 3.9, and for 2003, it's 2.2. The question is about the percentage decrease from 2002 to 2003. \
\
So, to calculate the percentage decrease, the formula is: ((Old Value - New Value) / Old Value) * 100. \
\
Plugging in the numbers: (3.9 - 2.2) / 3.9 * 100. Let me do the math. 3.9 minus 2.2 is 1.7. Then, 1.7 divided by 3.9 equals approximately 0.4359. Multiplying by 100 gives 43.59%. \
\
Wait, but the answer needs to be in percentage terms. The question says "percentage decrease," so this calculation should give the correct percentage. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. Yes, 2002 is 3.9 and 2003 is 2.2. So the decrease is from 3.9 to 2.2. That's correct. \
\
So the percentage decrease is approximately 43.59%. But maybe the answer expects rounding. The original numbers are in one decimal place. Let me check if the exact calculation is needed. \
\
Alternatively, maybe the answer is presented as a percentage with one decimal place. Let me compute 1.7 / 3.9. Let me do that division more accurately. 1.7 divided by 3.9. Let's see, 3.9 goes into 1.7 0.435... times. So 43.59%, which rounds to 43.6%. However, looking at the table, the numbers are given with one decimal place. But the question is about the percentage decrease, so maybe\

Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage decrease of state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects from 2002 to 2003. \
\
First, I need to find the values for state and local income taxes in 2002 and 2003 from the table provided. \
\
Looking at the table, under the "state and local income taxes after federal income tax effects" row, the value for 2002 is 3.9 and for 2003 it's 2.2. \
\
So, the decrease is from 3.9 to 2.2. To find the percentage decrease, I can use the formula:\
\
Percentage Decrease = [(Old Value - New Value) / Old Value] * 100\
\
Plugging in the numbers:\
\
Old Value (2002) = 3.9\
New Value (2003) = 2.2\
\
Difference = 3.9 - 2.2 = 1.7\
\
Percentage Decrease = (1.7 / 3.9) * 100\
\
Let me calculate that. 1.7 divided by 3.9 equals approximately 0.4359. Multiplying by 100 gives 43.59%. \
\
So, the percentage decrease is approximately 43.59%. The question might expect rounding, but since the original numbers are in one decimal place, maybe round to one decimal place as well, which would be 43.6%. However, the exact value is 1.7/3.9*100. Let me check the division again.\
\
1.7 divided by 3.9. Let me compute that more accurately. 1.7 \'f7 3.9. Let me do this division step by step. \
\
3.9 goes into 1.7 zero times. Add a decimal point. 3.9 into 17.0 (tenths). 3.9*4=15.6, which is 4. So 0.4, remainder 1.4. Bring down a zero: 14.0. 3.9 goes into 14.0 three times (3*3.9=11.7), remainder 2.3. Bring down another zero: 23.0. 3.9\
