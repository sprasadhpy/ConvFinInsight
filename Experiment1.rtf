\
--- LLM + Calculator ---\
Predicted:\
To calculate the total return for Delphi Automotive PLC and the automotive supplier peer group for the five-year period ending December 31, 2015, we need to consider the initial investment, dividends received, and final value.\
\
For Delphi Automotive PLC:\
Initial investment on November 17, 2011 = $100.00\
Final value on December 31, 2015 = $418.67\
Total dividends received = $0.25 per share per quarter for 8 quarters in 2014 and 2015 = $0.25 * 8 = $2.00\
\
Total return for Delphi Automotive PLC = Final value + Total dividends - Initial investment\
Total return = $418.67 + $2.00 - $100.00 = $320.67\
\
For the automotive supplier peer group:\
Initial investment on November 17, 2011 = $100.00\
Final value on December 31, 2015 = $171.91\
Total dividends received = $0.25 per share per quarter for 8 quarters in 2014 and 2015 = $0.25 * 8 = $2.00\
\
Total return for the automotive supplier peer group = Final value + Total dividends - Initial investment\
Total return = $171.91 + $2.00 - $100.00 = $73.91\
\
Difference in total return = Total return for Delphi Automotive PLC - Total return for the automotive supplier peer group\
Difference in total return = $320.67 - $73.91 = $246.76\
\
Therefore, the difference in total return on Delphi Automotive PLC and the automotive supplier peer group for the five-year period ending December 31, 2015 is $246.76.\

 Match (numeric)\
\
--- LLM + Calculator ---\
Predicted:\
To calculate the percentage change in earnings per share from 2005 to 2006, we first need to find the earnings per share for each year.\
\
In 2005:\
Net income = $596 million\
Earnings per share = Net income / Total shares outstanding = $596 million / 11502516 shares = $596,000,000 / 11502516 = $51.82\
\
In 2006:\
Net income = $711 million\
Earnings per share = Net income / Total shares outstanding = $711 million / 11502516 shares = $711,000,000 / 11502516 = $61.82\
\
Now, we can calculate the percentage change in earnings per share:\
Percentage change = ((Earnings per share in 2006 - Earnings per share in 2005) / Earnings per share in 2005) * 100\
Percentage change = (($61.82 - $51.82) / $51.82) * 100\
Percentage change = ($10 / $51.82) * 100\

--- LLM + Calculator ---\
Predicted:\
To calculate the percentage change in goodwill from 2009 to 2010, we use the formula:\
\
Percentage Change = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value) * 100\
\
Initial Value (Goodwill in 2009) = $6.1 billion\
Final Value (Goodwill in 2010) = $8.6 billion\
\
Percentage Change = (($8.6 billion - $6.1 billion) / $6.1 billion) * 100\
Percentage Change = ($2.5 billion / $6.1 billion) * 100\
Percentage Change = 0.4098 * 100\
Percentage Change = 40.98%\
\
Therefore, the percentage change in goodwill from 2009 to 2010 is approximately 40.98%.\

Expected:  8.8\
 Match (numeric)\
\
--- LLM + Calculator ---\
Predicted:\
To calculate the working capital turnover, we use the formula:\
\
Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / Average Working Capital\
\
First, we need to calculate the average working capital for 2015:\
\
Average Working Capital = (Working Capital at December 31, 2014 + Working Capital at December 31, 2015) / 2\
Average Working Capital = ($809 million + $886 million) / 2\
Average Working Capital = $847.5 million\
\
Now, we can calculate the working capital turnover for 2015:\
\
Working Capital Turnover = $7426 million / $847.5 million\
Working Capital Turnover = 8.75\
\
Therefore, the working capital turnover in 2015 is 8.75.\

Predicted:\
To find the accumulated depreciation at the end of 2006, we need to calculate the total amortization expense from 2005 to 2006.\
\
Total amortization expense for 2005 = $136.0 million\
Total amortization expense for 2006 = $183.6 million\
\
Total amortization expense from 2005 to 2006 = $136.0 million + $183.6 million = $319.6 million\
\
Accumulated depreciation at the end of 2006 = Accumulated depreciation at the end of 2005 + Total amortization expense from 2005 to 2006\
\
Accumulated depreciation at the end of 2005 = $646.56 million\
\
Accumulated depreciation at the end of 2006 = $646.56 million + $319.6 million = $966.16 million\

Predicted:\
To calculate the percentage change in the gross unrecognized tax benefits from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011, we need to find the difference between the beginning and ending amounts, then divide by the beginning amount and multiply by 100 to get the percentage change.\
\
Beginning amount at October 1, 2010: $19,900\
Ending amount at September 30, 2011: $32,136\
\
Difference = Ending amount - Beginning amount\
Difference = $32,136 - $19,900\
Difference = $12,236\
\
Percentage Change = (Difference / Beginning amount) * 100\
Percentage Change = ($12,236 / $19,900) * 100\

To calculate the percentage of purchased loans accounted for under the level-yield method included in the carrying amount of loan receivable net of purchased loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method, we need to first determine the total carrying amount of loan receivable net of purchased loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method.\
\
Total carrying amount of loan receivable net of purchased loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method = $920 million\
\
Carrying amount of loan receivable accounted for under the cost-recovery method = $359 million\
\
Therefore, the carrying amount of loan receivable accounted for under the level-yield method = $920 million - $359 million = $561 million\
\
Now, to find the percentage of purchased loans accounted for under the level-yield method included in the carrying amount of loan receivable net of purchased loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method:\
\
Percentage = (Carrying amount of loan receivable accounted for under the level-yield method / Total carrying amount of loan receivable net of purchased loans accounted for under the cost-recovery method) x 100\
Percentage = ($561 million / $920 million) x 100\

Predicted:\
To calculate the profit per share in 2019 with the same growth rate as 2018, we first need to determine the total profit for 2019. \
\
Given that profit per share for 2018 was $10.26 and profit was $6.147 billion, we can calculate the total number of shares outstanding in 2018:\
Total shares outstanding in 2018 = Profit / Profit per share\
Total shares outstanding in 2018 = $6.147 billion / $10.26 = 599,418,604 shares\
\
Next, we need to calculate the total profit for 2019 using the same growth rate as 2018:\
Total profit for 2019 = Total shares outstanding in 2018 * Profit per share growth rate\
Total profit for 2019 = 599,418,604 shares * 20% = $7.137 billion\
\
Finally, we can calculate the profit per share in 2019:\
Profit per share in 2019 = Total profit for 2019 / Total shares outstanding in 2018\
Profit per share in 2019 = $7.137 billion / 599,418,604 shares = $11.91\

To find the 2011 to 2012 change in equipment and other rents as a percentage of the total expense increase in 2012, we first need to calculate the total expense increase in 2012.\
\
Total expense increase in 2012 = Operating expenses in 2012 - Operating expenses in 2011\
Total expense increase in 2012 = $14,181 million - $13,833 million\
Total expense increase in 2012 = $348 million\

Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100\
\
Plugging in the values:\
New Value (2002) = $156.7 million\
Old Value (2001) = $363.9 million\
\
Percentage Change = (($156.7 - $363.9) / $363.9) * 100\
Percentage Change = (-$207.2 / $363.9) * 100\
Percentage Change = -0.569 * 100\
Percentage Change = -56.9%\
\
Therefore, the percentage change of total debt from 2001 to 2002 was a decrease of 56.9%.\

\
--- LLM + Calculator ---\
Predicted:\
To calculate the percentage cumulative total return for NetApp Inc. and the Nasdaq Composite for the five-year period ending 4/14, we can use the formula:\
\
Percentage Return = ((Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value) * 100\
\
For NetApp Inc.:\
Beginning Value = $100.00\
Ending Value = $197.58\
\
Percentage Return for NetApp Inc. = (($197.58 - $100.00) / $100.00) * 100 = 97.58%\
\
For Nasdaq Composite:\
Beginning Value = $100.00\
Ending Value = $253.22\
\
Percentage Return for Nasdaq Composite = (($253.22 - $100.00) / $100.00) * 100 = 153.22%\
\
Now, to find the difference in percentage cumulative total return between NetApp Inc. and the Nasdaq Composite:\
\
Difference = Percentage Return for Nasdaq Composite - Percentage Return for NetApp Inc.\
Difference = 153.22% - 97.58% = 55.64%\
\
Therefore, the difference in percentage cumulative total return for the five-year period ending 4/14 between NetApp Inc. and the Nasdaq Composite is 55.64%.\

To calculate the accumulated depreciation at the end of 2007, we need to find the total accumulated amortization for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007.\
\
Total accumulated amortization at the end of 2005 = $646.56 million\
Amortization expense for 2006 = $183.6 million\
Total accumulated amortization at the end of 2006 = $646.56 million + $183.6 million = $830.16 million\
Amortization expense for 2007 = $178.3 million\
Total accumulated amortization at the end of 2007 = $830.16 million + $178.3 million = $1008.46 million\
